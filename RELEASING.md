# Releasing

This is released from the `master` branch. Unless and older version needs patching, when it is release from the `7.0.x` branch. If there is no branch for the release that needs patching, create it from the tag.

## Cutting the release

### Requires contributor access

- Check the [draft release notes](https://github.com/playframework/play-mailer/releases) to see if everything is there
- Wait until [master build finished](https://travis-ci.com/github/playframework/play-mailer/builds) after merging the last PR
- Update the [draft release](https://github.com/playframework/play-mailer/releases) with the next tag version `$VERSION$` (eg. `8.0.3`), title and release description
- Check that Travis CI release build has executed successfully (Travis will start a [CI build](https://travis-ci.com/github/playframework/play-mailer/builds) for the new tag and publish artifacts to Bintray)
